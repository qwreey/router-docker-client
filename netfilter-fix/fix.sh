# See router-docker's own docs/egress-netgate.md, "Docker의 DOCKER-INTERNAL 강제 격리"
# section, for the full story of why this exists (that repo's own consumer, code-docker,
# has this service wired up in its docker-compose.yml as a worked example). Short version:
# newer Docker Engine builds install a
# DOCKER-INTERNAL nftables chain for any `internal: true` network that unconditionally
# drops FORWARD-path packets leaving that network's bridge whose destination isn't inside
# the bridge's own subnet - this blocks router's whole egress design at the host level,
# regardless of what router's own iptables does internally. DOCKER-USER is the chain
# Docker reserves for exactly this kind of override, always evaluated before
# DOCKER-FORWARD/DOCKER-INTERNAL.
#
# Runs with network_mode: host (see docker-compose.yml) so it can reach the host's own
# network namespace/netfilter tables at all - a container's NET_ADMIN only grants admin
# rights within its OWN netns otherwise, same reason code-docker's own NET_ADMIN-less
# netns can't touch this itself. Uses `nft` directly instead of the `iptables`
# compatibility layer so there's no ambiguity about which backend (legacy xtables vs
# nftables) actually gets written - dockerd manages DOCKER-USER natively via nftables
# (confirmed via `nft list ruleset` on the affected host), so this talks to the exact
# same objects with no translation layer in between.
#
# The internal network's bridge name (br-<first 12 hex chars of the network ID>) changes
# across `docker compose down`/`up` cycles, so this re-resolves it every cycle and cleans
# up any rule left over from a previous incarnation - the same reconcile-loop idiom
# router-docker's own config/netgate/firewall.default.sh uses inside router itself.
#
# On SIGTERM/SIGINT (i.e. `docker compose down` or `docker compose stop`), removes every
# rule it added before exiting - the exemption's lifetime is tied to this container's own,
# so tearing down the stack doesn't leave a stale DOCKER-USER ACCEPT sitting on a host that
# no longer needs it.
#
# NETWORK_NAMES is a space-separated list, not a single name - NETFILTER_FIX_INTERNAL_NETWORK
# (named after this tool itself, not any particular consumer - see CLAUDE.md's env var naming
# note; defaults to code-docker-internal since code-docker was this tool's first consumer) is
# the consuming project's own primary internal network, and NETFILTER_FIX_EXTRA_INTERNAL_NETWORKS
# is for any additional `internal: true` network a sibling/overlay project attaches router to.
# Kept as two separate env vars deliberately: a sibling overlay setting
# NETFILTER_FIX_EXTRA_INTERNAL_NETWORKS can never accidentally clobber the primary project's own
# default exemption, since Compose environment merging replaces a key's value wholesale rather
# than appending to it.
